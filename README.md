# Page-Replacement-Algorithms


Step 1: Download the file named Project_2.java, which contains four page replacement algorithms: OPT, FIFO, LRU, and SEC.

Step 2: To get started, open a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and import the file. While the console output may differ slightly depending on the specific IDE you're using, the overall output should be similar across all IDEs.

Step 3: Inside the main method of the file, you'll come across five strings that contain distinct page reference strings. Ensure that the reference numbers in each string are separated by commas, as the program uses the split method to read each reference, which operates by splitting the input string at every comma. By default, these strings should already be separated by commas, ready for execution.

Step 4: Execute the file, and the IDE console will display the resulting output.
